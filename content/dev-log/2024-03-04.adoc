// :toc:

Not a whole lot of exiting stuff since the last time I bothered to write one of these.

I mostly fiddled with the styling of the blog.

* Messed around with the info/links contained in the footer.
** Funnily enough I now have https://github.com/Landhund/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/commit/32cfc49481dee60d56effed4b0bfb4848fc5414b[two separate links] to the repo of the blog...
* Improved the rendering of https://github.com/Landhund/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/commit/01712e3582166d692b614c3ff0457bca55bd7f4e[admonition blocks]
** Not a fun experience in the (s)css-mines...
Only a small change was needed, but _finding_ what needed changing was a chore.
* Redid almost the entire https://github.com/Landhund/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/commit/afa94b285aa6ca2927a60d48c8b9bd4928f79009[formatting of the footer partial html].
It was a complete compacted mess, almost impossible for a human to parse.
Now it's over 30 lines longer, but much more readable and editable.
* Added properly created and configured https://github.com/Landhund/Landhund.github.io/commit/c0e6eec9ac279ea33d3e3d67827269ae8a56b840[favicons], including a working webmanifest
** Turns out that documention contains https://github.com/Landhund/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/commit/a47e4169a89f3eb60194b9525ad18e25393836fb#diff-ac7df548abdedf392d30e5caa44708ce64756c0b21f0c0c7beac4339dd74a122[valuable information]...
* Fiddled with the logo and title of the main page.
** Still not _entirely_ happy with the results, I'll definitely fiddle with it https://github.com/Landhund/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/issues/4[a bit more]


Fun fact at the end:
I've learned that Google has indexed my blog once I've got my first spam-mail via the link in the footer.
I was surprised how quickly both of them worked!
And I'm very happy my spamfilter has coughed everything thrown at me so far.
