== About the Blog

You've found my blog!
Not sure how you managed to find it, but I'm glad you did.

Currently, there isn't a whole lot to see, since I mostly use this to occasionally dump some ideas or thoughts from my brain into some more permanent media.

But fret you not, I have an RSS-feed!
For some reason...
Does anybody still use RSS-feeds?
For more than following webcomics?

== About Me

I'm an electrician by trade, a nerd by passion and an electrical engineer by profession.
This mix of skills and passions has led me into an odd position where I have to deal with both rough-tough contractors, ivory-tower IT-security specialists and misbehaving servers and computers with phantom directories that simply can't be deleted.

I love it!
