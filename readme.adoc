Hi there!
This is the repository for my blog https://landhund.github.io/[MAD CAD IT], hosted via https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] on https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages].

Well, you are welcome to have a look around, it's a public repo after all, but don't expect too much in the way of documentation.
I haven't gotten around to write much of it.

If I'm honest, I'm not even sure if I remember everything I did when I first set this up...
But it works!
For now.

If, despite all this, you still think this project is worth some support, you can: +
